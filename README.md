==================

## Instructions

  1. Add the following fields to a viewcontroller
  2. Add a button for submit, by default this button should be disabled.
  3. Validate your different fields. If someone tries to leave the field before
     they put in a valid item, pulse the field red and bigger/smaller.
  4. As soon as all valid items are entered, have the submit button come in
     from the bottom.
  5. AutoLayout this...it should work in horizontal or vertical!
  6. Don't worry too much about the fact that in horizontal the bottom may
     be covered by the keyboard.

### The Fields (all are required)

  1. Email
  2. Email confirm
    * should be the same as Email
  3. Phone
  5. Password

## Extra Credit
